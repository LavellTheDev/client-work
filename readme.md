# Client Work
Ah...wonderful little green squares! Everybody loves em and everybody who is hiring is always looking for a healthy amount of them.

But most developers understand that having a github full of green squares isn't always realistic or representative of the kinds of work we may be doing or the platforms we do the work on.

I love github and use it often to manage projects and also explore ideas and experiment with new skills or technologies I've learned. But the reality is a lot of my work often exists on other platforms. And unfortunately, that means no little green squares for me (even if <em>I am</em> coding everyday)!

Seeing the empty spaces instead of green squares has always annoyed me because it's not accurate.  And yet so much weight is put on the amount of them you have in your profile. So, I thought it would be funny and fun to try and use [gitfiti's](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti) python script to mark up the empty spaces on my github with $$$ signs to properly represent when I am working on client projects or on other platforms.

So if you're a hiring manager or fellow engineer snooping on my green squares to see if I actually code - yes i do, just not always on github. Work life balance is important y'all and so is branching out onto other platforms (badum tssssss).

If you'd like to see a more cohesive representation of my work - head over to my personal site www.illaisland.com where you can see the full breadth of my skills and experience. :)

When you see the dollar signs in my github profile, just know somewhere else I'm goin hard! BING BONG!
