# Client Work
Ah... wonderful little green squares! Everybody loves em and everybody who is hiring is always looking for a healthy amount of them.

But most developers understand that having a github full of green squares isn't always realistic or representative of the kinds of work we may be doing or the platforms we do the work on.

I love github and use it often to manage projects and also explore ideas and experiment with new skills or technologies I've learned.

But the reality is a lot of my work often exists on other platforms. And unfortunately, that means no little green squares for me (even if I am coding everyday)!

I thought it would be funny and fun to try and use ![https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti](gitfitti's) python script to mark up the empty spaces on my github to properly represent when I am working on client projects or on other platforms.


So if you are a hiring manager or fellow engineer snooping on my green squares to see if I actually code - yes i do, just not always on github.

If you'd like to see a more cohesive representation of my work - head over to www.illaisland.com where you can see the full breadth of my skills and experience. :)

When you see the dollar signs in my github profile, just know somewhere else I'm goin hard! BING BONG!
